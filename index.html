11/10/22 this week we made a circuit with LED's.
we made an explanation for if taking a year of math class is better or writing up too 1 million. 
me and my group mate made parrelel, series and voltage divider circuits.
we found that it would take 57 days straight to write too 1 million. 
But a math class would only be 1-2 hours a day so obviously the math class is better.
